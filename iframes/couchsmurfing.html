        AudioFiler is a machine learning song classifier built in ReactJS and Django. For this project our team compiled a dataset of 55,000 songs along with genre tags and used the pyAudioAnalysis library to extract 70 audio features on each song. These features were used to train Neural Nets and Random Forest models. Using the Spotify API to populate a fuzzy search, the site allows users to search for a song of their choice. The site returns an array of the guesses from 20 different instances of our model from the backend.
